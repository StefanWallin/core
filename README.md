![Static Web](https://staticweb.azurewebsites.net/img/logo.png)

# The gist
Static Web is not your daddys CMS. It's a CMS that is totally static. Which
means it's lightning fast in delivery. It differs from other static site
generators like jekyll in that it has a dynamic admin system like wordpress or
other web based CMS-systems.

Static Web is designed to be hosted either on Dropbox, Github or any other
non-localStorage storage provider supported by
https://github.com/flowertwig-org/jStorage. The key importance in those storage
providers is the ability to have permissions and writing over an oAuth-based
API. Github have full feature support since they also have Github Pages which
allow the pages to be served on the internet.

# Installation
If you have a github account, setup takes roughly 2 minutes and is totally free.

Either use the online installer(TODO in issue #6) or clone this repo into an
existing web server such as apache or nginx.

# Configuration options
There's a lot of configuration options.
